Meio.Autocomplete - a mootools plugin for creating autocomplete fields.

![Screenshot](http://github.com/fabiomcosta/mootools-meio-autocomplete/raw/master/Assets/image_forge.png)


Introduction
------------

This plugin creates an autocomplete list of options at the bottom of an input text or textarea element.
The list can be any other container that you like too. See the demos to understand it better.
Please don't hesitated to ask anything. Feel free.


Dependencies
------------

Meio.Autocomplete depends on Mootools-more Element.Forms.
It's included into the "/Assets" folder.
There's also a "BGIFrame.js" port into the "/Source" folder for solving the z-index issues with select and object elements on IE6.
You just need to include it into your page for it to work together with Meio.Autocomplete. It's completely optional.


Note
----

1.x and below are the versions made to be used with Mootools 1.2.x.
2.x and greater are the versions made to be used with Mootools 1.3.x or greater.


How to use
----------

This example shows most of its this plugin's options. All the values are the default ones.

    #JS
    var data = [
        {"value": 0, "text": "Brazil"},
        {"value": 1, "text": "Ajax"},
    ];

    var autocomplete = new Meio.Autocomplete(
        document.id('text_input_id'),
        data // can be an array
             // or an url (a JSON request will be created
             // or a function that should provide the data (see examples inside the documentation)
    );

### Class: Meio.Autocomplete.Select

This class does exactly what Meio.Autocomplete does plus it can easy act as a DOM select element,
putting the 'value' attribute of it's options into a form field (which will be called valueField).
It can synchronize its value with the valueField ondomready of the page, working perfectly when
the field comes pre-filled with a text value (like on an edit form).

#### Extends:

Meio.Autocomplete

#### Syntax:

    var mySelectAutocomplete = new Meio.Autocomplete.Select(element, data [, options]);

#### Arguments:

* **element** - (mixed) A string ID of the Element or an Element to apply the Meio.Autocomplete.Select List to.
* **data** - (mixed) An array of objects or a url to a page that will respond with a json object that will be converted to an array of objects.
* **options** - (object, optional) The Meio.Autocomplete.Select options object

#### Options:
* **syncName** - (mixed: defaults to 'id') Defines the parameter that will contain the unique identifier of the option that is selected at that moment (ondomready). If falsy it wont synchronize the value.
* **valueField** - (mixed: defaults to null) A string ID of the Element or an Element that will receive the unique identifier of the selected option. This is the field that will be used on your server-side so be sure it has the correct name attribute.
* **valueFilter** - (function: defaults to function(data){ return data.id; }) This function should return the unique identifier of the 'data' object.

Changelog
---------

##### 2.0
* This is basically the same as 1.0 but with full support for Mootools 1.3 and greater.

##### 1.0
* This is basically the same as 0.8.5 (with some code cleanups). The 1.x and before series support Mootools 1.2.x version. Meio.Autocomplete 2.x and greater support Mootools 1.3.

##### 0.8.5
* FIX: Fixed the select bug while synchronizing the value from the input that has the id with the text input on the Meio.Autocomplete.Select class;
* Small code improvements.

##### 0.84
* NEW: Adding the queryVarName option for the urlOptions, now it's possible to choose the name of the variable that stores the inputed query.
* NEW: Adding formatResponse option as a requestOptions. Redefine it if the array of autocomplete data is inside a key from your response. It receives as first parameter the jsonResponse and should return the array of autocomplete data.
* FIX: the value doesn't become empty while synchronizing the values at start anymore on Meio.Autocomplete.Select (and the Classes that inherit from it).

##### 0.83
* CHANGED: listInstance is not an option anymore, it's now the last parameter (after the options). See the new demo.
* FIX: the global cache uses safer keys now.
* FIX: rare error on page unload.

##### 0.82
* NEW: now there's the Meio.Autocomplete.Select.One Class that will replace a select element with an autocomplete field that will have the same options as the select, just removing the ones that have empty values.
* FIX: The list classes are now being correctly applied.
